\noindent\textbf{Paper: Interactive obstruction-free lensing for volumetric data visualization}\\

We have carefully read the four reviews of our submission, and we are thankful for the high level-of-detail that the reviewers took time to provide. We have covered all the
indicated points, and the current letter describes our answers to them (and, where needed, modifications done to the paper). We believe that by these changes we have managed to considerably improve the focus, quality, and positioning
of our work. To help reading, the original comments are in plain text. Our reactions are in \rr{italic blue}. For brevity, we do not mention below the correction of small-scale errors such as typos and word order.\\

\noindent Sincerely,\\
The Authors\\
